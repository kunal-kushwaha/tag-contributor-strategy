# Student WG Charter

## Introduction

Over the past few months, the CNCF has witnessed a surge of interest from students eager to participate in our programs. However, at present, the lack of structure around student initiatives presents significant challenges and opportunities for improvement. The Student Working Group is dedicated to addressing these challenges and providing a comprehensive solution for the student community. Our goal is to serve as a central hub for students interested in cloud-native technologies, offering resources, support, and guidance to help them thrive in this rapidly evolving field.

## Mission

Our mission at CNCF Students is to inspire and empower the next generation of cloud-native leaders. We believe in providing opportunities for students to learn and grow their skills in cloud-native technologies and open-source communities. 

## Goals

* Our mission is to cultivate an inclusive environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, and the advancement of cloud-native computing, regardless of students' backgrounds.
* We not only inspire and empower the next generation of cloud-native leaders but also foster a supportive community that encourages the growth and retention of contributors.
* Through the power of open-source, we strive to drive the adoption and growth of cloud-native technologies to make a positive impact on the world.
* We are dedicated to increasing CNCF project participation in mentorship programs by working closing with the `Mentoring WG` and general contributions to encourage the next generation of leaders in the field.
* Our goal is to expand participation in the KubeCon student track to provide a platform for students to showcase their ideas and connect with industry professionals.
* We aim to provide a centralized platform that serves as a one-stop-shop for students seeking to get involved in CNCF communities.
* We plan to establish a mentor-mentee framework that fosters collaboration, communication, and knowledge-sharing among students and industry professionals.
* To sustain our mission, we will develop a path for current students to pass on the torch and onboard new students as they grow, ensuring the continued growth and success of CNCF Students.
